# **Privox Privacy Policy (TAKEN FROM THE APP)**

## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to **Privox**! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Privox handles your information, the permissions it requires, and your rights regarding your data.

## **2. Permissions We Require**

To provide you with a seamless audio recording experience, Privox requests the following permissions:

### **a. Microphone (`RECORD_AUDIO`)**

- **Usage:** Essential for recording your voice or any ambient sounds.

### **b. Wake Lock (`WAKE_LOCK`)**

- **Usage:** Ensures uninterrupted recording by preventing your device from sleeping while Privox is active.

### **c. Foreground Service (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`)**
- **Purpose:** Allows Privox to run a foreground service for continuous recording.
- **Usage:** Ensures the app can record audio even when in the background or when the screen is off.

## **3. Battery Optimization**

### **Opting Out of Battery Optimizations**

- **Purpose:** Some devices may stop background services to conserve battery, interrupting recording.
- **Advantage:** Opting out allows Privox to continue recording without interruption.
